# Inspiration

We are insipred by reserachers, pioneers, and project creators. We inspired by [a programmer who fought cancer with 50 Nvidia Geforce 1080Ti](https://howardchen.substack.com/p/this-amateur-programmer-fought-cancer?s=r). We are inspired by endeavours.

> We want to make charity and research projects happen by connecting contributor with pioneers while fostering a transparent and accountable platform to fund these endeavors.

# What it does

We hope to incentivize public good projects through rewards and community engagement. 

- **The Project Creator** (Pioneer) creates an Endeavour, which contains a mission statement/summary, a description, a fundraising goal, and the creators. The NFT option is available, which allows rewards for top donors and random donors. The ticket cost and rewards are also defined.
- **The Project Donor** (Contributor) views the Endeavours, reads the descriptions, and donates. The Contributor receives awards, which may include a Twitter post for donation and money.

# How we built it

We used Chainlink to automate prize distribution and other important features including verfifying random winners, setting minimum USD donation amounts (price feed), and automate the smart contract checking process (Chainlink Keepers).

We used Moralis to integrate our backend with frontend, and we used it to store data from our operations.

We used ReactJS to build our frontend.

To keep the community engaged, we used NFTs that the Pioneers can generate on their own to give to their donators.

# Challenges we ran into

We started a week before the due date and two developer stopped working because they got COVID-19.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of

We have successfully built a working smart contract backend with all the features we have mentioned above! 

# What we learned

How to code frontend in Svelte, even though we ended up backpedaling to React. How to work with chainlink.

# What's next for Endevr
Expand to more general projects that require funding such as research and others.
